# AI-Lingo 🌐📚

Digital literacy has become an essential skill in the modern world, impacting everything from education to employment to everyday communication. Yet, two major groups are often left behind in this digital era:

- Children: Need foundational skills presented in fun and interactive ways.
- Seniors: May struggle with adapting to rapidly changing technologies.
